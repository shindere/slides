<p>2. Cross-compilation<br/><br/></p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Either being able to configure/compile on platform of architecture A (host) an OCaml compiler that produces native code for an architecture B!=A (target architecture)</li>
  <li>Or make the OCaml compiler able to produce native code for several architectures at the same time</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unifying Unix and Windows build systems (Work In Progress)</li>
  <li>Replacing the hand-written configure script by an autoconf script that works for all the platforms and has support for the concepts of host and target architectures</li>
  <li>(optional) Improving the build system itself: including sub-makefiles rather than calling make recursively, to let ``make'' see all the dependencies and thus make parallel builds more efficient)</li>
  <li>Improve distinction between code for the host system and code for the target system in the compiler itself</li>
</ul>
