<p>2. Cross-compilation<br/><br/></p>
<p>Purpose: being able to run ocaml on one host platform and produce native code for a different target platform. </p>
<p>This should work even when the size of words differs between the host and the target platform.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unifying Unix and Windows build systems (Work In Progress)</li>
  <li>Replacing the hand-written configure script by an autoconf script that works for all the platforms and has support for the concepts of host and target architectures</li>
  <li>(optional) Improving the build system itself: including sub-makefiles rather than calling make recursively, to let ``make'' see all the dependencies and thus make parallel builds more efficient</li>
  <li>Improve distinction between code for the host system and code for the target system in the compiler itself (32-bits host and 64-bits target seems the most difficult combination)</li>
</ul>
