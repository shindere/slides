<p>13. Other ocamltest features<br/><br/></p>
<p>External commands are run by a dedicated C library.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two implementations: Unix and Windows</li>
  <li>Allows fine-grained management of redirections, timeouts, processes, system resources...</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to compare output and reference files can be parameterized. By default it works as follows for text files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reference files are expected to be stored with Unix-style line terminators</li>
  <li>Under Windows, output files are converted to Unix-style end-of-lines.</li>
  <li>Output is compared to reference using cmp</li>
  <li>If they differ, they are compared again with diff and the output is part of the test log.</li>
</ul>
